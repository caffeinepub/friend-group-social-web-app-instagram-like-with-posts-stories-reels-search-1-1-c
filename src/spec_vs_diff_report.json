  "summary": "Diff adds a single Motoko backend actor with data models for profiles/posts/stories/reels/messages and adds substantial frontend structure: authenticated app routing/layout with a global header + navigation, AI Tools (writing tool, local image generator, local rules-based chatbot), Study Tools (whiteboard + slides), and multiple browser mini-games (Tic-Tac-Toe, Memory Match, Snake, 2048, Quiz). Some requirements cannot be verified due to many omitted/truncated added files. Clear gaps are avatar upload UI for profiles and the slides tool not showing support for multiple text blocks per slide.",

      "requirement": "Support optional avatar image in the in-app user profile, including a way for the user to set/upload it after first login.",
      "reason": "Backend profile type includes an avatar field, but the shown profile setup UI always submits `avatar: undefined` and provides no avatar upload/select control, so users cannot set an avatar from the UI based on available evidence.",
